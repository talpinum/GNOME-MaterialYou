# GNOME MaterialYou
A collection of GNOME 46 themes that follow a look similar to Android's material you.

*Note: if your system looks different from the screenshots it's likely due to a difference in extensions.
e.g.: these themes don't increase the size of thumbnail indicators in the overview, that's done through [this](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4158/gnome-40-ui-improvements/) extension.


# Installation
Copy the theme folders of your interest in the "~/.themes" folder (create it if you don't have it), then use the "User Themes" extension to change theme.

# App Theming

You can theme your programs' color by using [Gradience](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.GradienceTeam.Gradience), which I also used as inspiration for some of the color palettes of these themes.
